Parking Lot

Objects:-

1) ParkingSpace {premium, Normal}
2) Vehical { 2Wheeler, 4 Wheeler }
3) ParkingSpaceManager
4) EntryGate (1) but should be extendible (if more then take care of concurency)
5) ExitGate (1) but should be extendible 
6) ticket
7) payment


rough flow


car comes at EntryGate -> check availability of Space for car -> yes -> give ticket -> car gets Parked 
-> when leaving, show ticket at ExitGate -> pay Bill -> leave
